## Introduction to Yosys
It is the synthesizer used to convert RTL to netlist.
Netlist should be the same as the Design but represented in the form of standard cells.
The same testbench can be used to verify RTL and Synthesized Netlist.

# Day 2 - Timing libs, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis and Efficient Flop Coding Styles
Standard cell libraries are characterized across **PVT (Process, Voltage, Temperature)** conditions to model real-world variations.  

- **Process (P):** Variations due to fabrication (e.g., fast, slow, typical).  
- **Voltage (V):** Variations in supply voltage levels.  
- **Temperature (T):** Variations in operating temperature.  

üí° Library filenames typically encode these conditions:  
- **`tt`** ‚Üí Typical process corner  
- **`025C`** ‚Üí Characterized at 25 ¬∞C  
- **`1v80`** ‚Üí Characterized at 1.8 V  

**Example:**  
my_lib_tt_025C_1v80.lib
This corresponds to **typical process**, **25 ¬∞C temperature**, and **1.8 V voltage**.

<img width="827" height="834" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-25 212420" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323e2dfc-d72e-46eb-81b5-c88c10fb4109" />

## Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis

### Hierarchical Synthesis
##  Report after Synthesizing `multiple_modules.v`

After synthesis, the **sub-module statistics** are printed.  
- Example: `sub_module1` has **1 AND gate** and `sub_module2` has **1 OR gate**.  
- This demonstrates **Hierarchical Synthesis**.

###  Hierarchy Preservation
- `sub_module1` and `sub_module2` are instantiated separately in the synthesized Verilog netlist.  
- Instead of directly showing AND/OR gates, we see the **sub-modules** when running the `show` command (as seen in the screenshot).  

###  Inside `sub_module2` (in synthesized netlist `multiple_modules_hier.v`)
- Instead of an OR gate, the inputs **a & b** pass through an **inverter** and then a **NAND gate**.  
- Reason: In CMOS, stacking **PMOS** (as in an OR gate) is inefficient, since PMOS has lower mobility and must be made wider to achieve meaningful output.  
- Hence, the synthesis tool optimizes the OR function into **INV + NAND**.  

üëâ The next step is to analyze the **`.lib` file** for deeper understanding of how this mapping is performed.

### Flat Synthesis
The design can be flattened by using the command `flatten`.

Screenshot shows the command, synthesized netlist and the logical diagram.

### Sub-module Level Synthesis
RTL (Register Transfer Level) designs are often modular, with various functional blocks or sub-modules. Sub-module level synthesis allows each of these sub-modules to be synthesized independently.
## üîé Why Sub-Module Level Synthesis?

Sub-module level synthesis is an important step in digital design because it allows finer control and better results during optimization. Some key benefits are:

- **Optimization and Area Reduction:**  
  Each sub-module is optimized on its own. The synthesis tool can apply logic optimizations, technology mapping, and area minimization locally, which leads to efficient use of resources and a smaller overall chip area.  

- **Reusability:**  
  Sub-modules can be designed, verified, and optimized independently. Once created, they can be reused across multiple designs, saving effort and improving design productivity.  

- **Parallel Processing:**  
  For large projects, different sub-modules can be synthesized in parallel. This makes the overall synthesis process faster and more scalable.  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Running Sub-Module Synthesis  

Below are the commands to synthesize a specific sub-module:  

```bash
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog multiple_modules.v
synth -top sub_module1
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```

## Various Flop Coding Styles and Optimization

### Why do we need flops and how do they prevent glitches in the circuit?

Why Flops Help Prevent Glitches

Glitches in digital circuits often show up because of signal delays, noise, or timing mismatches. Flip-flops (flops) play a big role in keeping things clean and stable:

Synchronization: Flops are edge-triggered. They only ‚Äúlisten‚Äù on clock edges (rising or falling), so outputs don‚Äôt randomly toggle when inputs wiggle in between. This makes sure the output updates in a controlled way, not due to short-lived glitches.

Timing Control: Since flops are driven by a clock, all updates happen in sync across the design. That clocked behavior prevents mismatched arrival times of signals from creating unwanted glitches.

In short, flops act like a timing checkpoint‚Äîcapturing signals only at defined moments and filtering out noise or spurious transitions.

### Different types of flops
To initialize flops, we need to `set` and `reset` which can be synchronous or asynchronous

### Synthesizing mult2 (multiply by 2)

 
To implement `y[3:0] = 2*a[2:0]`, we append a `1'b0 `to the `a[2:0]` i.e, `y[3:0] = {a[2:0],0}`. This is also equal to left shift the input bits by 1.
This can be realized by just wiring.
So we expect no hardware which is also seen in the screenshot below, analysis after synthesis and show. The command 'abc' is not required for mapping when there are no cells.

### Synthesizing mult9 (multiply by 9 or 8+1)

`y=9*a` can be considered `8*a+1*a`
To implement `y[5:0] = 9*a[2:0]`, we append `000` to `a[2:0]` and then add `a` i.e, `y[5:0] = {a[2:0],000} + a[2:0]`.
This can be realized just by wiring.
So we expect no hardware which is also seen in the screenshot below, analysis after synthesis and show. The command 'abc' is not required for mapping when there are no cells.

# Day 3 - Combinational and Sequential Optimizations

## Introduction to Optimizations

### Combinational Logic Optimization
Logic optimization is all about squeezing the design to make it more efficient in terms of area and power.

Two of the most common techniques are:

Constant Propagation ‚Äì simplifying logic by directly replacing signals with known constant values.

Boolean Logic Optimization ‚Äì using methods like K-maps or Quine-McCluskey to minimize expressions.
<img width="618" height="324" alt="326310525-c8bd1118-52f7-441b-8cff-254d851cb892" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5babb75-241e-4a5c-9f56-66b47b66b19c" />


one such example is shown below
<img width="619" height="300" alt="326311271-aa864102-ef33-4d45-9ec9-929738172cd4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62166bce-2939-4c58-999f-dc6d233f04f3" />
### Sequential Logic Optimization
The technqiues used are:
1) Basic
   - Sequential constant propagation
2) Advanced (not covered as part of lab)
   - Static optimization
   - Retiming
   - Sequential logic cloning (floorplan aware synthesis)

An example of sequential constant propagation is highlighted below of DFF with asynchronous reset where D input is grounded. To note, the same technique cannot be applied to DFF with the asynchronous set because while `Q=1` when `Set=1`, but `Q=0` at `Set=0` at the next CLK pulse. Q is dependent not only on Set but also on the clock edge.

Retiming is a technique to improve the performance of the circuit.

module multiple_module_opt(input a , input b , input c , input d , output y);
wire n1,n2,n3;

sub_module1 U1 (.a(a) , .b(1'b1) , .y(n1));
sub_module2 U2 (.a(n1), .b(1'b0) , .y(n2));
sub_module2 U3 (.a(b), .b(d) , .y(n3));

assign y = c | (b & n1); 
endmodule
```

## Sequential Logic Optimizations

Both the dff_const1.v and dff_const2 are explained below.

<img width="851" height="415" alt="326765445-b9bede59-edaa-4f4f-ad90-9036c63aa4da" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcffee66-49e3-40a4-b13a-39f575bc804e" />
### Optimizing dff_const1.v

Syntax for dff_const1.v
```
module dff_const1(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		q <= 1'b0;
	else
		q <= 1'b1;
end

endmodule
```
For dff_const1.v, `q=0` as long as `reset=1`. However, when `reset=0` `q` doesn't immediately becomes `1` rather at the next rising edge of the `clk` as shown below. ***So the optimization cannot be applied***.

### Optimizing dff_const3.v (above images)

Syntax for dff_const3.v
```
module dff_const3(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
reg q1;

always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
	begin
		q <= 1'b1;
		q1 <= 1'b0;
	end
	else
	begin
		q1 <= 1'b1;
		q <= q1;
	end
end

endmodule
```
For dff_const3.v, there are two flops.  `q1=0` as long as `reset=1`. However, when `reset=0` `q1` doesn't immediately becomes `1` rather at the next rising edge of the `clk` with some propagation delay as shown below. `q=1` as long as `reset=1`, acting as `set` rather than `reset`. However, when `reset=0` `q` samples `q1` as `0` as there are some propagation delay for `q1`as shown below. At the next `clk` edge `q` samples `q1` as `1`.
***So the optimization cannot be applied***.

The command to run HDL simulation
```
iverilog dff_const3.v tb_dff_const3.v
./a.out
gtkwave tb_dff_const3.vcd
```
The HDL simulation is shown below.

The commands to run the synthesis
```
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog dff_const3.v
synth -top dff_const3
dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```

## Sequential Optimzations for Unused Outputs

### Optimization of Case1: 3-bit Up Counter with q[0] used (counter_opt.v)
Example of a counter where bits at the position of [2] and [1] are unused.

```
module counter_opt (input clk , input reset , output q);
reg [2:0] count;
assign q = count[0];

always @(posedge clk ,posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		count <= 3'b000;
	else
		count <= count + 1;
end

endmodule
```
The screenshot explains the logic of the counter. Only q[0] is used. ***So the optimization can be applied***.

The commands to run the synthesis
```
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog counter_opt.v
synth -top counter_opt
dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show
```
We see only one flop after the synthesis and also seen in synthesis report after `synth -top counter_opt.v`

### Optimization of Case2: 3-bit Up Counter (counter_opt2.v)

Example of a counter where all the bits are used.
```
module counter_opt (input clk , input reset , output q);
reg [2:0] count;
assign q = (count[2:0] == 3'b100);

always @(posedge clk ,posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
		count <= 3'b000;
	else
		count <= count + 1;
end

endmodule
```
The commands to run the synthesis
```
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog counter_opt.v
synth -top counter_opt
dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
